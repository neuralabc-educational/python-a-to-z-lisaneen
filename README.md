# python_primer_4_neuroscience
Intro notebooks for discussions and working through data and analyses in python

See here as well for a basic introduction to Google Colab: https://github.com/neuralabc/documentation/wiki/Google-Colab-Information

We will keep the intro notebooks here, and likely link to additional resources as necessary (for human fMRI/neuroscience, see also: https://github.com/neuralabc/PythonTools4Neuroimaging)

Planned coverage includes introductions to:
  - Google CoLab
  - Data, and how to get help
  - Data, importing and loading
  - Plotting
    - matplotlib
    - fancy?
  - Statistics
  - Running experiments
